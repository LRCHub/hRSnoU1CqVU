There's a wall standing between
us
And I'm gonna turn it down
Nothing is keeping me from your
love
I'm jumping over
Jumping cross that wall
Gotta get to you
Tearing down that wall
Just to be with you
Jumping cross that wall
Jumping over
That wall, that wall
I've wanting you for so long
There's trick I wouldn't do
Nothing is gonna get in my way
I'm jumping over
Jumping cross that wall
Gotta get to you
Tearing down that wall
Just to be with you
Jumping cross that wall
Jumping over
That wall, that wall
I cross the sky
To get to you
Oh, I'm getting closer, oh oh oh
Jumping cross that wall
Gotta get to you
Tearing down that wall
Just to be with you
Jumping cross that wall
Jumping over
That wall, that wall
I cross the sky
To get to you
Oh, I'm getting closer, oh oh oh
I cross the sky
To get to you
Jumping cross that wall
Gotta get to you
Tearing down that wall
Just to be with you
Jumping cross that wall
Gotta get to you
Tearing down that wall
Just to be with you
