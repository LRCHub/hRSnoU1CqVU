She remembered her walks on the
Primrose Hill
She could even hear her steps
She talked about the trees, the
mansion and the mill
The far distance ahead
She went out to see the burning
sky of April's end
I won't ever forget this time
we've spend
Just feeling the tickling grass
below
Sitting here in a closer wide
meadow
And as I jumped over the fence
I understood I couldn't miss my
chance
Sometimes I think this night
I might better have stayed home
But only for this elementary
lapse of reason
I thank God or anyone
I instantly knew my doubts had
gone
With all the bad plans I had
drawn
It's like she took my fate in
her hands
We started to run and feel as
giants
And as I jumped over the fence
I saw this most beautiful
evidence
